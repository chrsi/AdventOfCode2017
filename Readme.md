# Advent of Code 2017 
This is my Solution to the challenges from the Advent of Code 2017

# Project Structure
## AdventOfCode.Day**
Each Day is seperated by it's own project. It contains a Solver-class, which is responsible for solving the result (generic type) based on input data (string).

## AdventOfCode.Interface
The AdventOfCode.Interface project contains an Interface that has to be implemented by the solver for each day.

## AdventOfCode.UnitTests
The AdventOfCode.UnitTests project contains the tests (given input samples) for each day.
